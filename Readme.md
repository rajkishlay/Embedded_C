# Activities Description

|Activity|Description|
|:--:|:--:|
|Activity 1| Blink the LED when the passenger is in the seat and the heater is pressed|
|Activity 2| Convert the analog signal from the temperature sensor to the digital value|
|Activity 3| Generate the PWM signal according to the converted digital value|
|Activity 4| Send the temperature value to the serial monitor using UART protocol|

# Assumptions
* Switches are used to the realize the passenger in the seat and the press of the heater
* The temperature sensor is realized using the potentiometer
